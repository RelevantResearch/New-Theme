I am an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University's Lyman Briggs College, where I am also a Distinguished Teacher-Scholar Postdoctoral Fellow. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep commitment to understanding the complex intersections of migration, health, and social inequalities.

## Research Focus
My research explores critical questions at the intersection of international migration, health studies, and social justice. I am particularly interested in examining how structural inequalities impact immigrant communities' access to healthcare and their overall experiences within complex social systems.

### Key Areas of Interest
- Health inequalities
- Migration studies
- Race and gender dynamics
- Intersectionality
- Social and structural inequalities

## Academic Background
I completed my Ph.D. in Sociology from Binghamton University, where my dissertation investigated *"Healing the Immigrant Patient"* and the intricate relationships between immigration enforcement and the U.S. healthcare system. My international educational background—including degrees and study experiences in Turkey, France, and the Netherlands—has profoundly influenced my interdisciplinary approach to research.

## Teaching Philosophy
As an educator, I am passionate about creating inclusive learning environments that encourage critical thinking and social awareness. My courses have focused on topics like health disparities, gender, race, and immigration, always emphasizing the importance of understanding complex social dynamics.

## Languages and Perspectives
Fluent in Turkish, English, and French, with working knowledge of Spanish and Creole, I bring a multilingual and multicultural perspective to my work. This linguistic diversity allows me to engage with research and communities from various cultural contexts.
