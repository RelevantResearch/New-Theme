As a sociologist, I believe that education should empower students to critically analyze social structures, challenge inequality, and actively engage with the world around them. My teaching approach combines rigorous academic inquiry with real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intersectionality of race, gender, and immigration status in shaping social experiences.

Through my courses, I encourage students to think critically, engage in dialogue, and apply theoretical knowledge to understand the complexities of contemporary issues. I emphasize active learning through discussions, case studies, and research projects that encourage students to explore their own academic interests while connecting them to broader social issues.


## Courses I Teach
At **Michigan State University,** I offer courses that focus on the intersections of immigration, health disparities, and race. Here are some of the key courses I teach:
- Senior Seminar in Sociology (Fall 2022)

- Gender, Health, and Medicine

At **University of Florida,** where I previously taught, I led the following courses:

- Introduction to Health Disparities
- Discrimination and Health

## Student Mentorship
I am passionate about mentoring students both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I work closely with my students to guide them through their academic journeys, encouraging them to pursue their own research interests and engage with important sociological debates.

Some of my previous student mentees include:

- **M.A. Student:** Kelsey Malles, University of Florida
- **Undergraduate Student:** Lephtherie Estime, University of Florida

## Workshops and Guest Lectures
In addition to my regular courses, I have contributed to numerous workshops and campus talks focused on critical health disparities and feminist pedagogy. Some of these include:
