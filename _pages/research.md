My research examines the complex relationship between immigration enforcement, healthcare access, and health inequalities in the United States. Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks in sociology, critical health studies, and migration studies, I investigate how the intersectionality of race, immigration status, and healthcare policies shapes the lived experiences of marginalized communities, particularly immigrants.

Central to my work is the exploration of how immigration enforcement practices, such as public charge rules and deportation threats, impact access to care, health outcomes, and the overall well-being of immigrant populations. Through both qualitative and multi-method approaches, I strive to highlight the ways in which the healthcare system inadvertently perpetuates health inequities for racialized immigrants.

## Key Areas of Research

### 1. Immigration Enforcement and Health Inequalities
My research explores how immigration enforcement practices, such as deportation threats and detention, affect the health of immigrant populations. Specifically, I focus on the experience of documented Haitian immigrants and how healthcare providers' interactions with these individuals shape their health access, treatment, and care outcomes.

### 2. The Integration of Immigration Enforcement within Healthcare
I examine how immigration laws and policies are integrated into healthcare systems and how this integration contributes to the racialization of healthcare. This includes looking at the role of healthcare institutions in enforcing immigration policies, either through compliance with federal mandates or through their impact on immigrant patients’ willingness to seek care.

### 3. Critical Health Studies and Migration
My research also engages with critical health studies, investigating the ways in which migration status interacts with social determinants of health, including access to mental and physical health care. I draw from qualitative methods, such as interviews and participant observation, to understand how individuals navigate healthcare systems under precarious immigration statuses.

### 4. Health Disparities and Race
I explore the ways race and immigration status interact to shape health outcomes. I focus on how systemic racism in healthcare manifests in immigrant communities, particularly those from racialized backgrounds. This research highlights the implications of exclusionary policies on health access and outcomes, with a particular focus on race and class.

## Current Projects

### “Health at the Border: Documented Haitians’ Experiences with U.S. Healthcare”
This project investigates how Haitian immigrants in the U.S. experience healthcare, focusing on the impact of their legal status on their health access and outcomes. It seeks to explore the barriers created by immigration enforcement, from fear of deportation to explicit exclusion from care.

### “Healthcare as a Site of Political Struggle: Immigrant Rights and Health Justice”
This ongoing project looks at healthcare as a site of political contestation, examining how immigrant rights groups are mobilizing around issues of healthcare access. I am particularly interested in how immigrant communities fight for healthcare justice and challenge racialized healthcare policies.

### “The Role of Race and Immigration Status in Access to COVID-19 Care”
As part of my work on health disparities, I have been analyzing the impact of race and immigration status on access to COVID-19 care. This project explores how the pandemic exacerbated health inequalities for immigrants, particularly in relation to testing, vaccination, and treatment.


## Research Collaborations
I actively collaborate with scholars, healthcare professionals, and community organizations on projects that seek to address social inequalities and improve the health of immigrant populations. Some of my recent collaborations include:

- Collaborating with **Dr. Maria Gutierrez** (University of Florida) on a study of healthcare access for Latinx immigrants.
- Working with **the National Immigration Law Center** on the intersection of healthcare policy and immigrant rights.
