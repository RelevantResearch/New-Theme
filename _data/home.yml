  description: "I am an Assistant Professor and Distinguished Teacher-Scholar Postdoctoral Fellow at Michigan State University's Lyman Briggs College, with a focus on migration studies, critical health studies, race and ethnicity, and qualitative methods. In my research, I delve into the intricate intersections of immigration enforcement and health inequalities in the United States, particularly how racialized immigration laws impact access to care for immigrants. Through a historical lens, I explore how immigration politics shape the healthcare landscape, emphasizing the evolving role of immigration enforcement in producing and perpetuating health disparities. Using innovative qualitative and multi-methods, my work addresses the critical need for understanding how immigration policies and practices intersect with healthcare systems, especially in relation to marginalized communities."
